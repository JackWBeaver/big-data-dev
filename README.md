## Current
I am currently a senior at NW and will be graduating with a BS Data Science: Computer Science in December. I don't think I will be applying to get my masters right away, however, I might try to get it later on.

## Background
My hometown in St Joseph, MO which is a town not too far south of Maryville. I attended Lafayette High School and now reside in Kansas City, MO. Some of my hobbies are that I really enjoy playing golf, hanging out with friends, going to the lake, and playing video games.

## Plans
I would like to do something in Data Analytics after I graduate, but I am open to looking at multiple options once I get my undergraduate degree.
